# [Image Upscaling & Transparency](https://www.mousehuntgame.com/preferences.php?tab=mousehunt-improved-settings#mousehunt-improved-settings-feature-image-upscaling)

Updates the images across the MouseHunt interface to use the larger and transparent versions of the images where available.

Some of these images are not available in larger sizes by default, so they have been manually created.
