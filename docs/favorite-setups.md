# [Favorite Setups](https://www.mousehuntgame.com/preferences.php?tab=mousehunt-improved-settings#mousehunt-improved-settings-feature-favorite-setups)

Easily save and load your favorite trap setups. Find the "Favorite Setups" section below your trap stats on the Camp page.

When saving a setup, it will default to the name of the current location. Clicking the "Randomize" icon when editing a trap will automatically generate a unique name for your setup, otherwise you can name it yourself while editing.

The "Favorite Setups" button will also show the current setup name if you have it equipped.
